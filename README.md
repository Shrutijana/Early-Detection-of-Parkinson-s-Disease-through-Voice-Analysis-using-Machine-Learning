# Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease through Voice Analysis using Machine Learning


This project aims to develop a machine learning-based diagnostic tool for early detection of Parkinson's disease using voice analysis. Key components include exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model building, neural network implementation, and evaluation. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting Parkinson's disease based on voice features, potentially revolutionizing early screening and monitoring processes in clinical settings.
